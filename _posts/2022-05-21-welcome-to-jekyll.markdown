Hello there!

This website is an insight into my life. It is a way to get to know me if you haven't had the chance. I will use this blog post as a declaration of my intent towards creating this webpage.

As a student, there are many oppertunities to learn, work in a team, and devlop skills needed in the workforce. However, there is limited space to showcase what I have learned to my peers, recruiters, and anyone who is interested. This blog allows me to give an insight into the life of a student pursuing their ambitions to be a data-driven leader in the modern workforce.

In this blog I will showcase:
1. My personal projects (this site being one of them!)
2. My asipirations in the classroom and in my extracirricular activities
3. Projects I have completed in school
4. Important updates and/or insights I have that I wish I knew before becoming a student

Hopefully you enjoy my blog! Please visit again and I look forward to posting more often.

If you have any comments, questions, concerns, or want to connect please [Contact Me](/contact.md)
